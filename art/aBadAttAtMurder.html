                <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: The Calm Before The Storm (Part -1)</h2>
                <div class="chapter-content">
                    <p>It was a bone-chillingly cold night, an anomaly for a July evening in Kolkata. There were chances of heavy downpour as threatening storm clouds loomed overhead, casting the campus into a cloak of darkness as early as seven in the evening. The wind started howling mercilessly through the campus causing the streetlights to flicker above the murky pond. As the trees started dancing to the haunting melody of the howling wind, the graduate hostel building, with its peeling paint and broken window panels had an eerie silhouette, mirrored alongside the moonlit water surface. Mid-semester exams just got over and most of the students went back home for the summer break. Only a handful remained behind, some to reappear for supplementary exams, and others simply finding solace in the familiarity of the hostel walls.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ashani who was a final-year Masters student, in this institute specialized for higher studies in Mathematics and Statistics, belonged to the latter group of hostellers. He was waiting in the club room for his friends to return from the local market with supplies for the night, as his gaze fixed on the gloomy reflection. He was lost in his thoughts, when suddenly amidst the stillness, a familiar meowing sound from behind startled him.</p>
                    
                    <p>He turned to realize that it was none other than Midnight, his pitch dark feline buddy. Midnight nudged his legs gently, seeking attention as she continued to meow tenderly. Obliging to Midnight's demands, Ashani gave her a gentle pat as he chuckled softly at the unexpected visitor. Midnight usually stays with him when there are no classes, otherwise she roams around the entire hostel to observe everyone from afar, like a sniper scaling the enemy territory. As they were admiring the silhouette, Vishal, Akshay and Kriti came back with the supplies for the night.</p>
                    
                    <p>After a month of rigorous exams, tonight promised to be a night of fun, where they would sing their hearts out and hopefully make some unforgettable hostel memories. A total of fifteen people were staying back who had no exams to give and no classes to miss for a month. Abhay, one of Ashani's batchmate and childhood friend from the same school, was in charge of planning the party. Abhay's plan was for everyone to convene at 8 PM, indulge in thrilling games, cook up a storm, drink like there's no tomorrow and continue until dawn. With the last hostel party a distant memory, they aimed to elevate this one by decorating the club room with diwali-lights. Taking charge of the decoration were three juniors, Nitin, Soham, and Soumya, who had wrapped up their exams a day earlier than the rest.</p>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: The Calm Before The Storm (Part -2)</h2>
                <div class="chapter-content">
                    <p>Aabesh and Akash were both members of the college football team and were also known for their cooking skills in the hostel. After every tournament, they would cook for the entire team and other hostel residents who came to support them. Alok and Shiva, both first-year college students, were among the enthusiastic supporters of the football club. They were the only freshers among the current hostel residents, with everyone else being senior to them. The six of them, along with Urja and Sonam from the girl's hostel, were assigned the task of setting up the terrace for a barbecue party. Ashani and Midnight were supposed to gather dry wood, leaves, and buy charcoal from the market. Akshay and Abhay were busy setting up games, while Kriti and Vishal were in charge of arranging music and drinks. This plan was made a week before the start of the exams, and everyone had agreed to contribute in the best possible manner.</p>
                    
                    <p>Before I delve any deeper into the story and events that unfolded in the month starting that day, let me introduce myself and provide you with a brief description of our hostel. If you are among the readers who took note of the number of characters introduced thus far, you are going to notice that you are missing a character out of fifteen. I'm Ritwik, Ashani's batchmate and Midnight's partner in crime. My task for the night was mainly to help Midnight and Ashani since I knew where to find charcoal in the local market.</p>
                    
                    <p>Apart from us fifteen, seven more students stayed back and had an exam the following week. We intended to pack their food and deliver it to their rooms because they would not want to kill the entire night partying. As the story progresses, they shall be introduced one by one.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our campus is near the city limits of Kolkata, with three sub-campuses connected by two subways. The hostel's campus encompasses several structures, staff quarters, and two ponds alongside a football field. The boy's hostel is similar to 8 on a digital clock when viewed from above. This is where the majority of the events occurred. I'll provide a brief sketch of the boy's hostel below along with a description to the best of my abilities.</p>
                    
                    <p>Both hostels offered single-share rooms, with a shared bathroom which wasn't accessible from outside. Each room had its own balcony, where people used to hang clothes to dry; some turned it into a kitchen, and some had small gardens. Each room featured three doors: one for the balcony, one for the entrance, and one connecting to the common bathroom; and a double-panel window just next to the balcony door. Each room came with a bed, a chair, a built-in wardrobe, a bookshelf and a desk. Both hostels had four floors and beautiful terraces. I shared the bathroom with Ashani and Midnight, so we were neighbors in that way.</p>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: The Calm Before The Storm (Part -3)</h2>
                <div class="chapter-content">
                    <p>It was around half past seven when I knocked Ashani's door to get the charcoal before all the charcoal shops in the neighborhood closed. After hitting a few times, I knew he must be in the club room, admiring the beautiful weather. As I entered the club room, I spotted Ashani and Midnight staring at the reflection of the hostel building, abandoned in the 1980s, reflecting on the pond that formerly used to be a well. Abhay and Akshay discussed the order in which the games should be played, while Kriti and Vishal were busy directing Nitin, Soham, and Soumya where they should put each of the lights.</p>
                    
                    <p>I told Ashani that since the weather still sucked, we should get to the market early to buy some charcoal before the shops closed. We left the hostel campus with midnight tagging along, who always loved going for walks, especially on windy nights. Midnight waited for us at the hostel gates, as we looked for an auto. Just as we crossed the road, we came across Abhik and Saswata, who were from our batch and had a Topology compensatory paper the next day. They were carrying Xerox copies of their teacher's notes. To explain the compensatory paper, we need to know a bit more about our college.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our college was highly esteemed for its Mathematics and Statistics programs, with only thirty graduate and twenty master's students admitted each year. The institute provided generous monthly scholarships and nearly free hostel accommodations to each student. The majority of alumni either became professors at Ivy League universities or landed high-profile jobs in major corporations. To ensure the students' academic performance, there was a rule in place for all exams: you could fail an exam once, but if you failed it twice, you would be expelled from the institute. Therefore, all students were aware of the consequences of failing an exam and the importance of passing it on the first try to avoid taking the compensatory exam, which could eventually lead to expulsion.</p>
                    
                    <p>Abhik's experience was different from the average student. He had a knack for quickly grasping new concepts and realized he could pass exams by studying only on the last day. Consequently, he stopped studying altogether. However, the final semester courses were challenging for everyone, which explains why he is in this situation. To clarify, our college was one of the most prestigious institutions in Mathematics and Statistics, and it only admitted thirty graduate students and twenty master's students per year. The institute also provided each student with a generous monthly scholarship and nearly free hostel accommodations. The vast majority of alumni are either professors at Ivy League universities or working for major corporations. Due to the college's high standards, there was a rule in place for all exams: you could fail an exam once, but if you failed it twice, you would be expelled from the institute. Therefore, all students were aware that failing once would result in having to take the compensatory exam, which could eventually lead to expulsion.</p>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: The Calm Before The Storm (Part -4)</h2>
                <div class="chapter-content">
                    <p>Abhik's experience was different from that of the average student. He was able to pick up new things quickly, so he discovered he could pass by studying only on the last day. After that, he stopped studying altogether. However, the final semester courses were challenging for everyone to grasp, which explains why he is now in this situation.</p>
                    
                    <p>Saswata, on the other hand, was always hardworking despite being talented. He grew up in a difficult family where his uncle used to provide for the entire household. After his uncle passed away while he was still in school, Saswata had to provide for his family using his scholarship and manage some of the family business. It must be quite challenging for him to manage all of this in the final semester. Nonetheless, he has always performed above the average level of students in this college.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ashani was a top-performing student who always went out of his way to help others. He possessed exceptional talent and efficiency, but what impressed me the most about him was his ability to observe and gather statistics before coming to any conclusions. To be precise, Ashani approached everything in life with a statistical mindset.</p>
                    
                    <p>Abhik asked Ashani if he had Rahulda's notes, as Rahulda was our topology professor's favorite student.</p>
                    
                    <div class="dialogue">
                        "You only need the textbook, believe me. But, Saswata, didn't you find Rahulda's notes in his room when you moved last year?"
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Saswata nodded, "Only a few; the Topology ones were missing. His note-taking abilities were incredible; I still don't get it, you know."</p>
                    
                    <div class="dialogue">
                        "Maybe we'll never know, ahahaha,"
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>I said to Ashani, pointing out that we were running late and that we needed to get to the shop in fifteen minutes or we'd be late.</p>
                    
                    <div class="dialogue">
                        "You guys are coming for a short while, right?"
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>I inquired as Ashani began frantically calling for an auto.</p>
                    
                    <p>Abhik waved and responded.</p>
                    
                    <div class="dialogue">
                        "Yeah, sure, I won't miss it; I'll be there after 10! I'll bring Saswata, too! It looks like Ashani found the auto. Leave fast or you won't get the charcoal."
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>We hurried considering that we might have been late already. While we were in the auto, Ashani asked me</p>
                    
                    <div class="dialogue">
                        "Have you ever pondered why Rahulda did this? I never could come up with a plausible explanation. He received multiple PhD offers and a PPO from one of India's best investment banks. He never had a girlfriend that we know of. Why would he commit suicide all of a sudden?"
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="dialogue">
                        "There's a lot we don't know about Ashani. He only had a few friends, and the room remained locked for nearly two years. Only last year did Saswata move in. That's only because Abhik is my bathroom mate. He only found a few notes and a broken guitar in the room. We've never heard of any suicide notes either."
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="dialogue">
                        "Yes, but isn't that weird? A student in his final semester of master's studies, without incident, gets up in the middle of a class to use the restroom. Instead, he goes to the tenth floor terrace and jumps in broad daylight on a Friday."
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="dialogue">
                        "What's important about Friday?"
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="dialogue">
                        "Friday doesn't seem like a day to commit suicide, ahahaha. Monday seems more plausible! Furthermore, among those who are awake, suicide rates are highest at night. Rahulda was a night person, as we all know."
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="dialogue">
                        "Makes sense, but what if it was related to being alone at the hostel on weekends? Or was there something he had to deal with on weekends that he didn't want? I suppose there are several cases that cannot be ruled out."
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>We arrived at the shop before we could continue conversing. Ashani directed our auto driver to wait for a moment so that we could return in the same vehicle. Fortunately, the shop was open, and we were able to get enough charcoal for the night. We returned to campus in the same vehicle and continued the conversation on our way back, discussing various possible scenarios.</p>

            <div class="chapter">

                <div class="chapter-content">
                    <p>By the time we returned to the hostel, it was already eight-fifteen. The storm clouds had grown darker, and the first few drops of rain began to fall, creating small ripples on the pond's surface. Midnight immediately darted towards the hostel entrance, seeking shelter from the approaching downpour. As we hurried inside with the charcoal, I could hear the distant sound of music and laughter echoing from the club room.</p>
                    
                    <p>The transformation was remarkable. The club room, which just an hour ago had been dimly lit and somber, now glowed with warm yellow lights strung across the ceiling. Nitin, Soham, and Soumya had outdone themselves—the entire room looked like a festival venue. The diwali lights created dancing shadows on the walls, and someone had even arranged cushions and mattresses on the floor to create a cozy seating area.</p>
                    
                    <p>Kriti had connected her phone to the portable speaker system, and the room was filled with a mix of Hindi and English songs. Vishal was already behind the makeshift bar counter, arranging bottles and glasses with the precision of a professional bartender. The sight of everyone gathered together, laughing and chatting, almost made me forget about our earlier conversation regarding Rahulda.</p>
                    
                    <div class="dialogue">
                        "Finally! We thought you guys got lost in the storm,"
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Abhay called out as he spotted us entering with the charcoal. He was wearing a bright red shirt that made him look like the perfect host for the evening.</p>
                    
                    <div class="dialogue">
                        "The shop was almost closing, but we managed to get enough charcoal for the entire night. How's the setup going upstairs?"
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Ashani asked, setting down the heavy bag of charcoal near the door.</p>
                    
                    <div class="dialogue">
                        "Aabesh and Akash are already up there with the girls, getting the barbecue area ready. They've covered it with a tarp in case it starts raining heavily. Alok and Shiva are helping them arrange the seating,"
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Kriti replied, pausing her playlist to address us.</p>
                    
                    <p>Just then, Midnight appeared at my feet, looking expectant. She had this peculiar habit of sensing when food was being prepared and would position herself strategically to receive the best treats. I picked her up, and she immediately began purring, her eyes fixed on the direction of the kitchen area where some snacks were being prepared.</p>
                    
                    <div class="dialogue">
                        "Should we head upstairs then? I'm curious to see how the terrace looks,"
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>I suggested, still holding Midnight who seemed content in my arms.</p>
                    
                    <p>As we made our way to the staircase, I noticed that the usually quiet hostel had come alive. Doors that were typically closed were now open, with students moving freely between rooms. The atmosphere was infectious—everyone seemed to have temporarily forgotten about the stress of exams and the uncertainties of the future.</p>
                    
                    <p>However, as we climbed the stairs, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was different about tonight. Maybe it was the unusual weather, or perhaps it was our conversation about Rahulda, but there was an undercurrent of tension that I couldn't quite identify. Ashani seemed to sense it too, as he kept glancing toward the higher floors where Rahulda's incident had occurred two years ago.</p>
                    
                    <p>The terrace was a sight to behold. Despite the threatening weather, Aabesh and Akash had created a remarkable setup. They had arranged a barbecue pit in the center, surrounded by chairs and low tables. String lights hung from the terrace railings, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere. Urja and Sonam were busy arranging plates and cutlery on one of the tables, while Alok and Shiva were testing the sound system they had brought up from downstairs.</p>
                    
                    <div class="dialogue">
                        "This looks amazing! You guys have really outdone yourselves,"
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Ashani exclaimed, his earlier somber mood seemingly lifted by the festive atmosphere.</p>
                    
                    <p>But as I looked around at the cheerful faces and the beautiful setup, I couldn't help but wonder if this night would unfold as peacefully as everyone hoped. The combination of the storm, the eerie atmosphere, and the lingering questions about Rahulda's death had created a perfect backdrop for something unexpected.</p>
                    
                    <p>Little did we know that by morning, everything would change, and this night would become a pivotal moment in all our lives.</p>
